## Project Overview

Hustlemony is a tool that helps you get your side hustles without the hassle.

There are so many opportunities available online nowadays, and Hustlemony helps by curating them all for you in one place, where you can easily find and apply for them. Hustlemony automatically sends the potential client a pitch, once you choose to go forward with applying.

In no time, you'll be beating people to the gig since your pitch can get sent almost the instant a posting is made.

The following social platforms are looking to get supported:
- Facebook
- Nextdoor
- Craigslist

There is going to be a thin client side that you can use to apply for the job. There are automations available as well, in case you want Hustlemony to mass apply for you without going through the manual process.

For more information on the requirements of the project, please refer to the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/honeybadgerdeep/Hustlemony/blob/main/requirements.txt) file.
